# 1.1.2
- add `Func.memoize`
- fix `zip-all` and `zip-with-all` corner case (no input)
- build with LiveScript 1.4.0

# 1.1.1
- curry `unique-by`, `minimum-by`

# 1.1.0
- added `List` functions: `maximum-by`, `minimum-by`, `unique-by`
- added `List` functions: `at`, `elem-index`, `elem-indices`, `find-index`, `find-indices`
- added `Str` functions: `capitalize`, `camelize`, `dasherize`
- added `Func` function: `over` - eg. ``same-length = (==) `over` (.length)``
- exported `Str.repeat` through main `prelude` object
- fixed definition of `foldr` and `foldr1`, the new correct definition is backwards incompatible with the old, incorrect one
- fixed issue with `fix`
- improved code coverage

# 1.0.3
- build browser versions

# 1.0.2
- bug fix for `flatten` - slight change with bug fix, flattens arrays only, not array-like objects

# 1.0.1
- bug fixes for `drop-while` and `take-while`

# 1.0.0
* massive update - separated functions into separate modules
* functions do not accept multiple types anymore - use different versions in their respective modules in some cases (eg. `Obj.map`), or use `chars` or `values` in other cases to transform into a list
* objects are no longer transformed into functions, simply use `(obj.)` in LiveScript to do that
* browser version now using browserify - use `prelude = require('prelude-ls')`
* added `compact`, `split`, `flatten`, `difference`, `intersection`, `union`, `count-by`, `group-by`, `chars`, `unchars`, `apply`
* added `lists-to-obj` which takes a list of keys and list of values and zips them up into an object, and the converse `obj-to-lists`
* added `pairs-to-obj` which takes a list of pairs (2 element lists) and creates an object, and the converse `obj-to-pairs`
* removed `cons`, `append` - use the concat operator
* removed `compose` - use the compose operator
* removed `obj-to-func` - use partially applied access (eg. `(obj.)`)
* removed `length` - use `(.length)`
* `sort-by` renamed to `sort-with`
* added new `sort-by`
* removed `compare` - just use the new `sort-by`
* `break-it` renamed `break-list`, (`Str.break-str` for the string version)
* added `Str.repeat` which creates a new string by repeating the input n times
* `unfold` as alias to `unfoldr` is no longer used
* fixed up style and compiled with LiveScript 1.1.1
* use Make instead of Slake
* greatly improved tests

# 0.6.0
* fixed various bugs
* added `fix`, a fixp
